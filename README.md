tauGeodesic
====
This repository contains a Java implementation of the geodesic, mean, and variance algorithms designed by [Gavryushkin and Drummond](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3544), see `tauSpace` folder.

DOI for the release used in the arXiv publication: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/20754/gavruskin/tauGeodesic.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/20754/gavruskin/tauGeodesic)

`tSpace` folder under the corresponding branch is the work in progress aimed at efficient algorithm for phylogenetic time trees formalised as  t-space.
The space is introduced and motivated in http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3544.
Algorithms for t-space is a subject of an upcoming publication.
