tauGeodesic
====
This repository contains a Java implementation of the geodesic, mean, and variance algorithms designed in http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3544, see `tauSpace` folder.

`tSpace` folder is for the work in progress aimed at efficient algorithm for phylogenetic time trees formalised as  t-space.
The space is introduced and motivated in http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3544.
Algorithms for t-space is a subject of an upcoming publication.
